# How to create a challenge excluding certain entities :
## Step 1 :
### Add a tag (label) with an arbitrary name to all the entities you wish to not include in a challenge.
## Step 2 :
### Add all entities to a list with an arbitrary name.
## Step 3 :
### Add the 'Not Labeled with' with the value from step 1 (adding tags to entities) to step 2 (adding entities to list).
## Step 4 :
### Use the Special rule, 'Things in a List', with the value from step 2 (adding entities to list) to create your challenge.
## Step 5 :
### If you do not want to start a new run, use the console command 'Stage' with the current stage you are on to reload the rules and make sure everything works correctly.
### NOTE : THIS DOES NOT CAUSE A NEW SEED TO BE GENERATED, EVERYTHING WILL BE THE SAME
## TIPS AND TRICKS :
### 1. Make only one entity with a tag as the first line, then follow that line with your challenge's rules.
### 1.1 After making your challenge rules, set the setting that copies the first rule when a new rule is made, and just change the entity to whatever else you wish to exclude.
### 2. The order in the rules must be the steps in their order.
#### P.S. This is not fool proof, as I haven't tested everything yet. There is going to be an error, either in my method or Da Rules mod. I will try my best to update this as I find out more at later date.
#### P.P.S. I do not want credit if I am the source of knowledge.
