# How to create a challenge excluding certain entities :
## Step 1 :
### Add a tag with an arbitrary name to all the entities you wish to not include in a challenge.
## Step 2 :
### Add all entities to a list with an arbitrary name
## Step 3 :
### Add the 'Not Labeled with' with the value from step 1 (adding tags to entities) to step 2 (adding entities to list).
## Step 4 :
### Use the Special rule, 'Things in a List', with the value from step 2 (adding entities to list) to create your challenge.
## Step 5 :
### If you don't want to start a new run, use the console command 'Stage' with the current stage you are on to reload the rules, and make sure everything works correctly.
### NOTE : THIS DOES NOT CAUSE A NEW SEED TO BE GENERATED, EVERYTHING WILL BE THE SAME
#### P.S. I do not want credit if I am the first to come to you with this.
